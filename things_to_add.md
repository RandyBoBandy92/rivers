Okay, I can help with that! Restaurant websites often include a variety of sections to inform and engage potential customers. Besides the "About Us" and "Hours" sections you already seem to be working on, here are some other common and useful sections:
Menu: This is arguably the most important section. It should be easy to read, up-to-date, and ideally include prices. Some restaurants categorize their menu (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts, Drinks). PDF menus can be frustrating on mobile, so an HTML version is usually better.
Gallery: A collection of high-quality photos of the food, the restaurant's interior, and perhaps even happy customers or special events. This helps to visually entice visitors.
Contact Us: Essential information like address (with a map, if possible), phone number, email address, and social media links. A contact form can also be useful.
Reservations: Information on how to make a reservation, whether it's through a phone call, an email, or an online booking system integration.
Online Ordering: If the restaurant offers online ordering (for pickup or delivery), this section would integrate with or link to the ordering platform. You have an "Order Online" link, which is a good start.
Specials/Events: A place to highlight daily or weekly specials, upcoming events, happy hour details, or promotions.
Testimonials/Reviews: Featuring positive feedback from customers can build trust and credibility.
Blog/News: Less common for all restaurants, but some use a blog to share news, recipes, chef profiles, or articles about their cuisine or local sourcing.
Catering/Private Events: If the restaurant offers catering services or can host private parties, a dedicated section with details and inquiry forms would be beneficial.
Location/Directions: While this can be part of "Contact Us," a separate section with a clear map, parking information, and public transport details can be very helpful, especially for new customers.
Gift Cards: Information on purchasing gift cards, if offered.
Careers: For listing job openings at the restaurant.
You don't necessarily need all of these, but consider which ones would be most valuable for your restaurant and its customers.
